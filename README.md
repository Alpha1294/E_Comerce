- But the question arises, how many of those visits are actually trasnformed into a purchase, into money for the e comerce platform?On the left we get the percentage, so 0,08 would be a 8%

## Customer Analysis
- We have a total of 697.470 customers who purchased in october and november, from those 295.325 are repeat customers, so they bought something more than once.That would be a solid 42%!

## Quality over quantity?
- Our top 10% best customers (the 10% that buy the most) represent a 285.619.483 of the sales while the regular customers represent a 219.532.909 ,si our best 10% is actually more than 50% of the total sales.
- Next we do clusters of our customers, we keep the best 10% as a category we will call Star and divide the rest in 3 categories based on the sales they provided.
